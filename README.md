# Avatar Korra Themed RPG Web Game

A Web-Based jQuery Game

At page load, the player will need to select a charcter by clicking on the image available. This sets the game logic and locks the player with this selection until the game ends.

When the player selects the enemy by clicking the remaining pictures, this moves the enemy to the defender area and the
attack button becomes visible and live.

By clicking attack, the player damages the opponenent and the opponent counter attacks the player. The hit points, attack, and counter attack values are predetermined at the start of the game.

Each attack power is added to itself while the counter attack is a static number,
     
Whenever the player clicks 'attack', their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose 'HP' (health points).

When the defender's hit points are reduced to zero or below, the enemy is removed from the 'defender area' and the player character can now choose a new opponent.

The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game if their character's 'HP' falls to zero or below.
